# -- Introduction -- #
# WyvernMods contains many different modules. Each configuration section is separated based on the module it controls.
# Each module has a "master" configuration which completely enables or disables the module.
# If a master configuration is disabled, all the further configurations do not need to be adjusted.
# There may also be sub-modules that can be enabled and disabled.
# Module configurations are separated by formatted comments in this configuration file:

## >> MAJOR MODULE << ##
# > MINOR MODULE < #
# > END MINOR MODULE < #
## >> END MAJOR MODULE << ##

# Finally, there will also be configurations which are open-ended and allow an unlimited amount of configurations.
# These configurations will be annotated with "-#" appended to the configuration.
# These will always be identified with a dash in the configuration. For example, "itemCreation-1:"
# Every individual configuration made in this way needs it's own unique number after it (called an index).
# Multiple configurations with the same index will not apply properly. Make sure each configuration has it's own unique index.
# Finally, all multiple configurations will be separated using a colon (:) instead of an equals sign (=).

#disableGMEmoteLimit: By default, players must wait 5 seconds before the sound from another emote will play.
# This option allows GM's (power 1 or higher) to bypass this limit.

disableGMEmoteLimit=true
#creatureArcheryWander: When a creature is struck by an arrow from a long distance, they will fail to acquire the player as a target.
# This prevents them from moving in to attack someone who is archering them.
# In some cases, players were able to abuse this to gain archery skill at zero risk.

reduceImbuePower=true
#TODO: Add option to adjust multiplier on imbue power.
#fixVehicleSpeeds: When updating the speed of a vehicle, the vanilla code uses a random check to determine whether to update.
# This creates scenarios where the speed of a vehicle does not update properly for a long duration.
# For example, when archering a horse, it could take anywhere from 1 to 20 seconds for the speed to properly reduce.

# If they move the vehicle off their deed and disembark, they will no longer be able to command it.
mayorsCommandAbandonedVehicles=true
#opulenceFoodAffinityTimerIncrease: Adds 0.25% increased timer per power of opulence on a food.
# Example: Food grants 1 minute per bite. With 100 Opulence, it would gain 25% increased timer, giving 1.25 minutes per bite.
opulenceFoodAffinityTimerIncrease=true
#TODO: Add option to configure the amount of increase per opulence power. [Side-note: Maybe add to Spellcraft instead]
#disableFoodFirstBiteBonus: By default, when eating food the affinity timer will give 10x longer duration on the first bite.
# This creates a meta where taking a single bite out of a good affinity meal then waiting for the buff to expire is optimal to conserve food.
# This option disables that first bite bonus, making each bite grant the same duration regardless of whether it's the first
# bite or if they're adding onto an already existing food affinity timer.
disableFoodFirstBiteBonus=true
#bedQualitySleepBonus: The quality of the bed a player sleeps in will increase the amount of sleep bonus obtained after waking up.
# The increase in sleep bonus is equivalent to 0.5% more per QL of the bed. At 100QL, the bed will grant 50% more sleep bonus.

# This option fixes that interaction by making the code which handles mounted encumberance to adjust for the increase in strength.
fixMountedBodyStrength=true
#adjustedFoodBiteFill: Adjusts the amount of fill from foods from being linear along the QL axis.

adjustedFoodBiteFill=true
#TODO: Add additional options to configure the amount of food fill.
#rareMaterialImprove: Allows rare materials to potentially transfer rarity when improving normally, instead of only when consumed.
# This prevents players from being punished by combining rare materials, and offers a more intuitive approach to using rare materials.
rareMaterialImprove=true
#rarityWindowBadLuckProtection: This provides a new system that creates "bad luck protection" in rarity windows.
# Instead of being entirely random, the chance for a rarity window will increase each time the roll fails.
# Every time the roll succeeds, the chance will decrease to adjust. This creates a more even spread of RNG.
# Mathematically, this also helps prevent outliers such as having multiple rarity windows in a row or the opposite of not having any for a long duration.
rarityWindowBadLuckProtection=true
#rareCreationAdjustments: Rarity from creation materials will apply when creating new items.
# The following system only applies to items which are created in their entirety from two consumable resources.
# For example, using a rare handle and a rare sword blade to create a sword would use this system.
# Using a rare anvil and a rare lump will not use this system, since the anvil is not consumed in the process.
# Metallurgy does work. Using rare charcoal with rare iron will produce rare steel, for example.
# When the item is created, it will roll randomly between the two rarities of the resources used to create it, distributed equally.
# For example, using a rare handle with a supreme blade will give a 50% chance at a rare, and 50% chance at a supreme.
# Using a normal handle on that same supreme blade would yield a 33% chance at normal, 33% chance at rare, and 33% chance at supreme.
# Using a fantastic handle on the supreme blade would offer a 50% chance at supreme, 50% chance on fantastic.
# If both items are the same rarity, it completely guarantees that the resulting item will be the same rarity.
# A fantastic handle and a fantstic blade will always create a fantastic sword.
rareCreationAdjustments=true

# This option grants these bonuses at all times even if the title is not equipped.
alwaysArmourTitleBenefits=true
#tomeUsageAnyAltar: Allows sorcery tomes to be used at any 3x3 flat altar.

#keyOfHeavensLoginOnly: Forces Key of the Heavens to only be able to be used on the login server.
# This is done to prevent issues with deity generation.

#disableHelpGMCommands: Disables GM commands from appearing for non-GM's when using /help. This is a bug with the vanilla game.

reduceActionInterruptOnDamage=true
#TODO: Add multiplier option for chance to be interrupted.
#fixMissionNullPointerException: In rare instances, the Epic Mission system can fail to properly intialize it's item template list.
# When this happens, there's a chance that another function will call for a random item template.
# Upon execution, it fails to find a random template and crashes the server with a Null Pointer Exception.
# This option fixes this issue and will initialize the list if one does not exist when the server calls for a random template.
fixMissionNullPointerException=true
#disableSmeltingPots: Simply disables the functionality of smelting pots.
# Smelting pots will still exist, but it will display an error "Smelting is disabled." when attempting to smelt.

## >> ANTI-CHEAT MODULE << ##
## The Anti-Cheat Module helps mitigate client mods that allow players to utilize data that should never be sent.
## Wyvern Anti-Cheat does NOT prevent ESP mods.
## It does, however, do a fairly effective job at limiting the use of X-Ray and livemap for detecting ores they should not see.
enableAntiCheatModule=true

# > SPOOF HIDDEN ORE < #
# Spoofing hidden ore is the process of falsifying information sent to the client to hide ore they should not be able to see.
# This process works by the server identifying whether or not a player should be able to see a vein of ore through various checks.
# For example, if a vein is surrounded by 4 cave walls, the player should not be able to see that ore since it's completely surrounded.
# This system will "spoof" the data sent from the server to clients in the strip (area) around the vein as normal rock.
# This prevents anyone from using a client mod to see the vein (X-Ray or Livemap for example) which would normally be obscured from view.
# The system will have no effect on veins which players should normally be able to see. Exposed veins are not spoofed.
# Finally, this is also unable to be countered through any client modding efforts. Since there is no difference between the data
# that is sent instead of a normal rock vein, no amount of client modding would be able to surpass this anti-cheat method.

#prospectingVision: This system allows players with high prospecting skill to bypass the spoof system to a certain extent.
# In it's current implementation, after 20 prospecting, players will be allowed to see 1 tile out per 18 prospecting levels.
# For example, a player with 50 prospecting skill would receive proper information to their client up to 3 tiles into a wall.
# This system is meant to give information to players about what exists in a cave system without requiring them to prospect every wall.

#TODO: Add additional options to the spoof hidden ore minor module to configure further operation.

#mapSteamIds: This option will map player SteamID's to their name in the modsupport database under SteamIdMap.
# Since this option's creation, there has been a STEAM_IDS table added to the wurmplayers database by default which logs Steam ID's on each login.
# The default system works by logging the access times for each Steam ID and when it was connected, alongside the duration of the login.
# Overall, the default system is more accurate, but it's also quite difficult to read at a glance.
# Viewing a single player's Steam ID will require cross referencing their player WurmID with the PLAYERS table.
# What this option does is make a table that is simply NAME and STEAMID, with one unique entry each.
# This makes it very easy to find a player's Steam ID and ban it, if necessary.
# Additionally, it makes it simple to know all the SteamID's which have been used to access a single account.
# ! This table & option is also required for other certain functions in WyvernMods !

## >> QUALITY OF LIFE MODULE << ##
## The Quality Of Life Module includes some additions that improve the general quality of life of gameplay.
## Many of these options are built with a mindset of enhancing the play of normal players,
## but can be abused to significant gain by those who see them as an opportunity to make cheating easier.
## It's important to think of the abuse cases and whether or not you're okay with those abuse cases being
## available before enabling this module or its features.

#mineCaveToVehicle: Allows mining from cave wall directly into a vehicle while commander.
# Requires the fatigue action override under Misc Changes Module to function (otherwise you cannot mine while commanding a vehicle).
# When enabled, this will also deposit the ore directly into a BSB until full if one exists.
# If no BSB exists, it will deposit to crates until full.
# If no crates exist in the vehicle, it will simply mine into the cargo hold of the vehicle until it's full.
# If there is no space in the vehicle for the ore, it will mine to ground as normal until a full pile exists.
mineCaveToVehicle=true
#mineSurfaceToVehicle: Allows surface mining directly into a vehicle while commanding.
# This option is identical to mineCaveToVehicle, but applies to surface mining instead.
# Also requires fatigue action override in Misc Changes Module to function.
mineSurfaceToVehicle=true
#chopLogsToVehicle: Allows chopping up logs directly into a vehicle while commander.
# This option is identical to mineCaveToVehicle, but applies to chopping up logs instead.
# Also requires fatigue action override in Misc Changes Module to function.

#statuetteAnyMaterial: Allows casting using a statuette of any material.
# By default, a statuette that is not made of gold or silver will not work for spell casting.
# This option changes that functionality by disregarding the material and only checking the item itself.
# Will not allow players to use incorrect statuettes for casting (such as statuette of Fo to cast as a Vynora priest).
statuetteAnyMaterial=true
#mineGemsToVehicle: Allows mining gems and other materials (like salt) directly to vehicle.
# This option is identical to mineCaveToVehicle, but handles tertiary materials like gems and salt instead.
# Also requires fatigue action override in Misc Changes Module to function.
mineGemsToVehicle=true
#regenerateStaminaOnVehicleAnySlope: Allows players to regenerate stamina while on a vehicle regardless of the slope underneath the vehicle.
# By default, if you are on a slope greater than 20 while on a vehicle, you do not regenerate stamina.
# This option removes the 20 slope limitation and allows players to regenerate stamina while on a vehicle so long as they are stationary.
